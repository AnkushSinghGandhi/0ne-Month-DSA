# ðŸš€ 15-30 Days DSA Roadmap to Crack â‚¹10â€“15 LPA Offers

If youâ€™re short on time but aiming for solid product-based or top startup roles, this roadmap helps you focus on the **most important DSA topics** that give maximum ROI in interviews.

---

## âœ… Priority-Based Topic Breakdown

### ðŸ”¥ Tier 1: Must-Do 

> **These are asked in almost every interview** â€“ master them first.

#### ðŸ”¹ 1. Arrays & Strings
- Traversals & updates
- Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Prefix sums
- Sliding Window (min/max in window)
- Two-pointer technique
- String Operations
  - Substring
  - Palindromes
  - Anagrams
- Binary search and its variations:
  - Classic binary search
  - First/Last occurrence
  - Search in rotated sorted array
  - Binary search on answer (e.g., Painterâ€™s Partition)
- In-place operations (no extra space)

#### ðŸ”¹ 2. Hashing (HashMap / Set / Dict)
- Count frequency of elements
- Subarray with given sum
- Find duplicates / first unique
- Group anagrams
- Longest substring with no repeats
- **Understand concepts** (no need to implement):
  - Hash function basics
  - Collision handling

#### ðŸ”¹ 3. Linked Lists (Singly Only)
- Insert/Delete at head/mid/end
- Reverse (iterative & recursive)
- Detect cycle (Floydâ€™s Algorithm)
- Merge two sorted lists
- Find middle of the list
- Remove N-th node from end

#### ðŸ”¹ 4. Stacks & Queues
- Basic operations (push/pop, enqueue/dequeue)
- Valid parentheses
- Next greater element
- Monotonic stack / Min stack
- (Optional) Implement queue using stacks

### âš¡ Tier 2: Medium Priority

> Do these next. They're common but not always core.

#### ðŸ”¹ 5. Trees (Binary Trees & BST only)
- Inorder, Preorder, Postorder traversal (recursive + iterative)
- Level order traversal (BFS)
- Height of binary tree
- Is it a BST?
- Lowest Common Ancestor (basic version)

#### ðŸ”¹ 6. Recursion & Backtracking (Light)
- Factorial, Fibonacci (base recursion)
- Subsets, combinations, permutations
- Light backtracking (optional): Sudoku, N-Queens

#### ðŸ”¹ 7. Heaps (Priority Queue)
- K largest/smallest elements
- Sort nearly sorted array
- **Understand**:
  - Min-heap / Max-heap logic
  - Heapify, insert/delete (no need to code)

#### ðŸ”¹ 8. Greedy Algorithms
- Activity selection / Interval scheduling
- Fractional knapsack
- Minimum number of platforms needed

---

### ðŸ§Š Tier 3: Optional 

> Only if you have time or the company asks for these topics.

#### ðŸ”¹ 9. Graphs
- DFS and BFS traversal
- Detect cycle (undirected)
- Topological sort
- Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (basic understanding)

#### ðŸ”¹ 10. Dynamic Programming (Very Basic)
- Fibonacci with memoization
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Longest Common Subsequence

## ðŸŽ¯ Questions to practice no just memorize them.....
**[LeetCode 75 Study Plan](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/)**.

### Why LeetCode 75?

- It's a **curated set of 75 essential problems** used by top tech companies.
- Covers core DSA patterns with increasing difficulty.
- Helps solidify your concepts and prepare you for real-world interview problems.

---

## ðŸ§  Final Tips

- Focus on **patterns**, not just individual problems.
- Practice problems from **LeetCode (Easy/Medium)** in each category.
- Skip implementation-heavy topics like AVL, Segment Trees, etc.
- Keep your code clean & dry-run your logic in interviews.
